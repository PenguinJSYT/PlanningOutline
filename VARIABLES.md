# Variables

## What is a Variable?
Google defines a variable as "able to be changed or adapted: The drill has a Variable speed".

A Variable in Javascript is defined using three key words: var, let, and const.
They store data such as words or numbers, and can be manipulated using code.

## The keywords explained.

### var
**var** was used in older versions of javascript, but is now out dated and should not be used in modern code.

`var balance = 500;`

### let
**let** is a way of defining a variable that you want to be updated or changed in the future.

`let age = 23;`

### const
**const** is a way of defining a "constant" variable, or one that you do not want other parts of your code to change.

`const name = "Jamie";`
